# Simple JS tasks
 Simple JS tasks with their solutions in ascending order. 

Every task consists of a short description, a sample input you can use to test your solution and the expected output of that sample input. 
The task is to write code that takes in that input, processes it according to the task's description, and then produced an output. 

While there isn't a single ultimate solution and a set of solutions are possible, the expected output is always the same, which means that there are multiple different ways of solving a given problem. For example, you have to find the sum of two numbers, the expected output is always the same (2+2=4), but you could use different approaches to reach the right answer.

Example:

Description: Write a program that will print on the console "Hello, world!"

##  Input: 
    no input (In this case)

## Expected Output: 
    Hello, world!

## -----------SOLUTION----------- 

/Here will be the solution of the task

P.S. These tasks were part of my JS educations.
Only the solutions are mine. 

I would love to see some smarter solutions than mine. Everybody is welcome to join the party. :)
