# Problem 8. Compare arrays

Write a program that reads two number arrays of size N from the console and compares them element by element.


## Input:

    On the first line you will receive the number N
    On the next N lines the numbers of the first array will be given
    On the next N lines the numbers of the second array will be given


## Output:

	Print Equal if the two arrays are the same and Not equal if they are not


Examples:


## Input  

	3 1 2 3 1 2 3 	

## Output

	Equal

## Input  
         	
	3 2 4 6 6 4 2 	

## Output

	Not equal





## Problem 9. Compare Character Arrays Lexicographically

Write a program that compares two arrays with all of their elements being a single string character (like a string) lexicographically (letter by letter). Research how to convert string to array.


## Input:

    On the first line you will receive the first array as string
    On the second line you will receive the second array as string


## Output:

    Print First if the first array is lexicographically smaller
    Print Second if the second array is lexicographically smaller
    Print Equal if the arrays are equal


Examples:


## Input:          	

	telerik teleric 	

## Output: 

	Second


## Input:

	2 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 2 1 	

## Output:

	3


## Problem 11. Is Array Sorted?

Write a program that determines if an array of numbers is sorted in increasing order.

	1 2 4 8 12 34 200 2000 	

## Output:

	Yes

## Input: 
                                        	
	7 8 9 10 11 12 11 13 9 	

## Output:

	No


## Problem 12. Find Two Biggest Numbers

Write a program that finds the two biggest numbers from an array of integers


Examples:


## Input:  
                                 	
	8 2 1 3 5 8 9 11 2 5 	

## Output:

	11 9

## Input:   
                                	
	8 7 8 11 7 11 5 8 10 	

## Output:

	11 11

## Problem 13. Is Array Symmetric

Write a program that finds if an array of numbers is symmetric - that is, the first number is equal to the last, the second - to the second last and so on


Examples:


## Input   
                    	
	1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 	

## Output

	Yes

	7 8 9 8 7 	

## Output

	Yes

## Input 
                      	
	3 4 5 3 4 5 	

## Output

	No


# Problem 14. Is Array in Wave Form

Write a program that determines if an array of numbers is in Wave Form -
e.g. first > second < third > fourth < fifth > ...


Examples:


## Input  
             	
	2 1 2 1 2 1 2 	

## Output

	Yes

## Input   
            	
	7 3 5 2 8 4 	

## Output

	Yes

## Input               	

	2 1 3 4 2 3 	

## Output

	No


# Problem 15. Negative-Positive Sort

Write a program that moves all negative numbers to the beginning and all positive to the end, without changing the order of positive negative


Examples:


## Input  
                                     	
	7 2 -2 1 -5 4 5 -3 1 	

## Output

	-2 -5 -3 7 2 1 4 5 1



## Problem 16. Print Maximum Increasing Subsequence

Write a program that prints the maximum length increasing subsequence to the console. If two or more are of the same length, print the last one


Examples:


## Input   
                                        	
	6 7 3 8 1 9 4 5 6 2 1 3

## Input    
                                       	
	1 2 3 4 3 1 9 4 5 6 11 	

## Output

	4 5 6 11

## Problem 17. Repeating Numbers

Write a program that finds the repeating number. All other numbers occur only once.
