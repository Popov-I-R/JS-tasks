## Problem 1. Compare arrays

Write a program that reads two number arrays of size N from the console and compares them element by element.


Input:

    On the first line you will receive the number N
    On the next N lines the numbers of the first array will be given
    On the next N lines the numbers of the second array will be given


Output:

Print Equal if the two arrays are the same and Not equal if they are not


Examples:


Input           	
3
1
2
3
1
2
3 	

Output
Equal

Input           	
3
2
4
6
6
4
2 	

Output
Not equal





## Problem 2. Compare Character Arrays Lexicographically

Write a program that compares two arrays with all of their elements being a single string character (like a string) lexicographically (letter by letter). Research how to convert string to array.


Input:

    On the first line you will receive the first array as string
    On the second line you will receive the second array as string


Output:

    Print First if the first array is lexicographically smaller
    Print Second if the second array is lexicographically smaller
    Print Equal if the arrays are equal


Examples:


Input:          	
telerik
teleric 	

Output: 
Second


Input:           	
own
owned 	

Output:
First


Input:           	
omg
omg 	

Output:
Equal

## Problem 3. Maximum Sequence

Write a program that finds the length of the maximum sequence of equal elements in an array of numbers.


Examples:


Input:                               	
2 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 2 1 	

Output:
3


## Problem 4. Is Array Sorted?

Write a program that determines if an array of numbers is sorted in increasing order.


Examples:


Input:                                          	
1 2 4 8 12 34 200 2000 	

Output:Yes

Input:                                         	
7 8 9 10 11 12 11 13 9 	

Output:
No


## Problem 5. Find Two Biggest Numbers

Write a program that finds the two biggest numbers from an array of integers


Examples:


Input:                                   	
8 2 1 3 5 8 9 11 2 5 	

Output:

11 9
Input:                                   	
8 7 8 11 7 11 5 8 10 	

Output:
11 11
