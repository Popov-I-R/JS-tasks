# Foreign Languages #

Write a program, which prints the language, that a given country speaks. You can receive only the following combinations: 
•	English is spoken in England and USA;
•	Spanish is spoken in Spain, Argentina, and Mexico;
•	For the others, we should print "unknown";


--- SOLUTION ---

function solve (country) {
    let result = 'unknown'
    switch (country) {
            case 'England':
            case 'USA': 
                result = 'English'
        break;
        case 'Spain':
        case 'Argentina':
        case 'Mexico':
            result = 'Spanish'
            break
    } 
console.log(result)
}
